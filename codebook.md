Running the R program to perform data analysis

R file name: run_analysis.R
R Function: run_analysis()
Preparation before calling the run_analysis() function:
- setwd("<the path to directory 'UCI HAR Dataset' where Samsung data file exist>")
- put the R file "run_analysis.R" into above directory
- source("run_analysis.R")
- run_analysis()

Description of the DATA

Output file: subject_activity_mean.txt

1. leading t or f is based on time or frequency measurements.
2. Body = related to body movement.
3. Gravity = acceleration of gravity
4. Acc = accelerometer measurement
5. Gyro = gyroscopic measurements
6. Jerk = sudden movement acceleration
7. Mag = magnitude of movement
8. mean and SD are calculated for each subject for each activity for each mean and SD measurements.

The units given are g’s for the accelerometer and rad/sec for the gyro and g/sec and rad/sec/sec for the corresponding jerks.

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:
‘-XYZ’ is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions. They total 33 measurements including the 3 dimensions - the X,Y, and Z axes.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are:

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation

The values in output data file are the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
